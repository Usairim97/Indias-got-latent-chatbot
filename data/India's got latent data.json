  "title": "India's Got Latent",
  "description": "India's Got Latent is a Hindi-language digital entertainment show launched on June 14, 2024. Created and hosted by comedian Samay Raina, the show blends humor, talent discovery, and satire into a unique parody of traditional talent competitions. The word 'Latent' emphasizes discovering hidden abilities of contestants in a fun and unpredictable environment.",
  "format": "The show follows a quirky talent-show format. Contestants predict their own scores before performing. Judges score their performance, and if the predicted score matches the average judge score, the contestant is declared a 'Latent Winner.' This concept highlights self-awareness and adds comedic unpredictability.",
