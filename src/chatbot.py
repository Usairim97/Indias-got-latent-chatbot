India‚Äôs Got Latent was a unique comedy talent show hosted by Samay Raina, co-hosted by Balraj. It was filmed at The Habitat and streamed on YouTube from June 2024 to February 2025.

The format: contestants predicted their scores before performing. If judges' average matched their prediction, they became a 'Latent Winner'. It featured 12 episodes + 6 bonus episodes, guest judges, viral roasts, and experimental humor.
Bonus Episode 6: Guests Ranveer Allahbadia, Ashish Chanchlani, Apoorva Mukhija, Jaspreet Singh join Samay to hilariously critique India's latent talents
A major controversy in Bonus Ep 6 involving guest judge Ranveer Allahbadia led to the show‚Äôs removal. He asked a contestant: "Would you rather watch your parents have sex every day for the rest of your life or join in once to make it stop forever?" This triggered public outrage, FIRs, court cases, and political discussion about digital content regulation.

This chatbot was built from a rare dataset manually collected from every episode. It includes:
- Deep breakdowns: judges, performances, scores
- Contestant predictions vs actual
- Jokes, memes, viral moments
- Format, purpose, controversies

Ask anything about the show ‚Äî judges, episodes, jokes, controversy, impact ‚Äî it‚Äôs all here.
